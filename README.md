## :scroll: Description
How many days from summer?. This beautiful but unuseful app can help you with that. Sure you can change the date you are looking forward, making the wait work, with a confetti celebration.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Getting familiar with compose animations, a great weekend project.
I was able to do a working porting of the famous konfetti library to compose (100% compose): https://github.com/eltonkola/Konfetti
The dot lines animated background ported from this project: https://github.com/halilozercan/compose-dotsandlines

Image background from: https://www.xtrafondos.com/en/wallpaper/2880x1800/1620-pink-mountains.html
